### Estimation: before looking at the old code:

* How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?

It will most likely take about an hour to implement this new feature.

* How many files will you need to add or update? Why?

I will need to add one file to contain the feature used to display Turtle view. 
I will also need to alter the menu that is used to select with views are visible 
in the GUI. I will also need to update the class for Turtles to respond to the 
clicking of a image.
