## SLogo Addition

### Estimation: before looking at the old code:
- How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?  
I think it will take about an hour and a half to implement the new feature.

- How many files will you need to add or update? Why?
I would estimate I have to edit around 6 or 7 files to accomodate the STAMP and CLEARSTAMPS commands
since these new commands will require new code in both the front and backend to achieve the desired
functionality.
